## My process

### Built with

- JavaScript ES6+
- MVC architecture
- OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)

### What I learned

This project was a significant milestone for me, as it was my first major application utilizing JavaScript. I applied the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, which helped me organize and structure my code more efficiently. I also delved deeper into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), creating modular and reusable code. Some of the main things I learned include:

- How to implement and structure an MVC architecture.
- Making API calls and handling responses.
- Managing application state using JavaScript.
- Creating bookmark and pagination functionalities for a better user experience.

### Continued development

Moving forward, I want to enhance my understanding of advanced JavaScript, especially in terms of working with APIs and asynchronous operations. Additionally, I plan to refine my skills in OOP and explore other architectural patterns to see what fits best for different projects.
